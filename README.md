# drone_game

A small game I'm making whilst I learn the Bevy Game Engine. The aim of the game is to get from the red starting podium to the green finishing podium - without colliding the drone into anything else.

Warning - This game is not complete and is still being developed.

## Compilation

A rustup installation is required to compile. The instructions for doing this can be found at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

Once rustup is installed, clone this repository and build+run using cargo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sam-Bowden/drone_game
cd drone_game
cargo run --release
```
